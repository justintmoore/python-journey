# Automate The Boring Stuff By Al Sweigart

## Description  
This python program takes a dictionary, and loops through using the `items()` method, pulling out the key and value. Once the key:value
is taken out, I print to the screen

## Comments
I had difficulty for some reason getting the key and value to come out in the right format. I attempted to make the code more verbose than
neccessary, and as a result got confused myself further. Be humble, stay hungry, and keep striving. I'd like to look back on this repo one day
and laugh at the things I found difficult!

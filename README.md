# Python Journey: A Trail of Growth and Application

This GitHub repository is a **paper trail of my progression with Python**, showcasing my learning and application of programming concepts. It documents my journey from foundational principles to their practical use in cybersecurity.


## My Python Background

My formal introduction to Python began with a **beginner's course at my local university**. This provided a strong foundation in core programming principles, syntax, and problem-solving methodologies.

Additionally, I had the valuable opportunity to serve as a **Teacher's Assistant (TA) for a year** within this Python program. This experience significantly deepened my understanding of fundamental concepts as I helped guide fellow students, troubleshoot code, and explain complex ideas. It also honed my communication and problem-solving skills, which I believe are highly transferable to collaborative cybersecurity environments, especially within **Incident Response** teams.


## What You'll Find Here

This repository is organized to showcase my evolution as a Python developer, featuring code examples, exercises, and small projects that demonstrate my learning. You'll see my exploration of how Python can be leveraged for various cybersecurity tasks, including:

* **Log analysis** for **Detection and Analysis** (NIST 800-61).
* Scripting for understanding **Discovery** (MITRE ATT&CK T1046) tactics.
* Automating routine tasks to support **Containment** and **Eradication** efforts within incident response workflows.
* Interacting with security tools and APIs for **Threat Hunting** data enrichment.

Each section or project aims to connect my Python learning back to real-world cybersecurity challenges and demonstrate its utility in building defensive capabilities.



## My Goal

My ultimate objective is to become a highly respected Cybersecurity Engineer, focusing on **Blue Team roles** such as SOC Analyst, Threat Hunter, Detection Engineer, and Incident Responder. This `python-journey` repository is a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and my dedication to building the practical skills necessary to achieve that goal.
